## Markdown Conversion

The markdown files were automatically converted from the PDF versions using `pdftotext` with layout preservation. The conversion maintains:

- Mathematical notation and formulas (as text)
- Document structure and organization
- Tables and diagrams (as ASCII art where applicable)
- Chapter headings and section structure

**Note:** While the markdown format preserves the textual content, some visual elements like mathematical typesetting, complex diagrams, and special symbols may be better viewed in the original PDF files.

## Using the Files

### Reading
- For the best reading experience with properly typeset mathematics, use the PDF files
- For searchable text content and integration with text-based tools, use the markdown files

### Searching
The markdown files are particularly useful for:
- Text searching across all parts
- Integration with version control systems
- Processing with text analysis tools
- Indexing and reference lookup
